# Foundational Code Standards

These Foundational Code Standards establish a core set of best practices for software development.
They serve as the foundation for our language-specific style guides, promoting code clarity,
consistency, maintainability, and security.

## General Principles

### **COMPASS**: Navigate Your Way to Exceptional Code

The journey towards exceptional software requires a well-defined compass – a set of core
principles to guide development practices. The COMPASS acronym, encompassing **C**onsistency,
**O**ptimized, **M**aintainable, **P**erformance, **A**daptable, **S**calable, and **S**ecure,
offers a valuable framework for building high-quality, efficient, and demonstrably secure codebases.
These principles seamlessly integrate with established software development practices, fostering a
strong foundation for success.

/// define

### **C**onsistency

- **Adopt a Unified Coding Standard:** Consistency minimizes complexity and fosters seamless
  collaboration. By adhering to a shared set of coding standards, developers can ensure their
  codebase remains accessible and maintainable for everyone. Readability and clarity are paramount,
  allowing developers of all experience levels to navigate and understand the code with ease. This
  focus on consistency promotes long-term maintainability of the project.

### **O**ptimized

- **Balance Efficiency with Clarity:** While performance is a priority, optimizations should be
  implemented judiciously, with a keen eye on maintaining readability and future maintainability.
  The key lies in achieving performance gains without obscuring the code's original intent. Clear,
  well-structured code that performs efficiently – that's the objective.

### **M**aintainable

- **Write for the Future:** Embracing practices that look ahead to future developments creates code
  that is inherently adaptable and easy to update. This approach ensures resilience and smooth
  evolution alongside new technologies and requirements, prioritizing maintainability as a core
  principle.

### **P**erformance

- **Responsibly Utilize Resources:** Performant code is a cornerstone of exceptional software. This
  means writing code that utilizes system resources meticulously, delivering a responsive and
  seamless user experience. Efficiency is key, integrating considerations for algorithm efficiency
  and resource management throughout the development process. Importantly, performance enhancements
  should never come at the expense of code readability or future maintainability.

### **A**daptable

- **Embrace Change:** The software development landscape is inherently dynamic. Designing code to be
  flexible and open to change is paramount. This adaptability allows for seamless integration of new
  technologies and methodologies, keeping projects at the forefront of innovation.

### **S**calable

- **Plan for Growth:** Scalability should be central to development strategies. By adopting coding
  practices and architectural decisions that allow the system to handle increasing loads and
  complexity gracefully, applications can be built to grow and adapt to expanding user bases and
  data volumes.

### **S**ecure

- **Prioritize Security:** Security should be woven into the very fabric of the development process.
  By incorporating robust security practices from the outset, developers can prioritize user data
  protection and system integrity. Mitigating potential vulnerabilities throughout the development
  lifecycle is paramount.

///

Promoting these principles aims to inspire a commitment to excellence, security, and efficiency
across the global software development community, encouraging a collaborative approach to
creating software that is both innovative and enduring.

## Formatting

[//]: # (TODO: Custom icon for admonition)
/// admonition | Note
While adhering to these formatting guidelines is recommended for new projects to ensure readability,
maintainability, and consistency, they are not rigid requirements. The overarching principle is to
maintain consistency within a project or team. In cases where an existing codebase already follows a
well-structured and defined formatting style, it may not be beneficial to reformat the code solely
to align with these guidelines. For GoatBytes.IO projects, this represents the preferred style, but
flexibility is key, especially when collaborating on or contributing to projects with established
conventions.
///

### Indentation

- Use 2 spaces for indentation to ensure code is readable on various editors and platforms.
    - **Exceptions:**
        - **C++**, **Python**, **Rust**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
        - **Go:** Use tabs for indentation.
- Use 4 spaces for continuation lines to distinguish them from regular indents.

### Line Length

- Enforce a maximum line length of 100 characters to improve readability and manageability.<br>
  Allow flexibility in cases where breaking lines would reduce readability or disrupt the logical
  flow of the code.

### Whitespace

- Include a space before parentheses and the left brace `{` for control structures
  (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.).
- Include Space around all operators (`->`, `=`, `+`, `*`, `/`, `>>`, etc.), except before unary and
  range operators.
- Include a space before `else`, `catch`, and `finally` keywords.
- Include space around ternary and Elvis operators.
- Add a space after commas in type arguments and other comma-separated lists.
- Ensure a space before and after a colon in contexts like dictionary entries or type annotations.

### Brace Style

- Adopt the [K&R][K&R] brace style:
  ```c
  if (x < 0) {
    printf("Negative");
  }
  ```
- Braces are not required for single-line blocks but may provide clarity.

### Blank Lines and Spacing

Use blank lines strategically to separate logical blocks of code for better readability.

- Use `0` blank lines in certain areas like before `}`, or around field declarations.
- Use `1` maximum blank line in areas like between method definitions or after class definitions.
- Use `2` maximum blank lines to separate sections more distinctly (e.g. package declarations).

### Alignment

- Align descriptions of parameters, exceptions, and properties in documentation comments.
- Align parameter lists and constructor arguments for readability.

## Naming Conventions

Adopting consistent naming conventions is fundamental to enhancing code readability and
maintainability. By establishing clear patterns for naming various elements, developers can quickly
understand the structure and purpose of the code.

### General Approach

Consistent naming conventions serve as a quick guide to understanding code. They help in making the
codebase easier to read, understand, and maintain. Remember, following language-specific style
guides is crucial for maintaining consistent and readable code across the codebase.

### Case Types

- **PascalCase:**
    - Used for classes, interfaces, and enum types, highlighting their use as definitions or
      templates.
- **camelCase:**
    - Employed for function names across most programming languages, with notable exceptions for
      languages with their own idiomatic practices, such as Go and Python.
    - Used for variable names, except in languages or scenarios where `snake_case` is the norm.
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**
    - Reserved for constants and Enum constants, signaling their immutable and static nature.
- **snake_case:**
    - Preferred for variable and function names in Python, Ruby, and for keys in JSON objects,
      aligning with these languages' and data formats' conventions.

### Variables

- **Boolean Variables:** Prefix boolean variables and functions with `is` or `has` to indicate a
  true or false value, enhancing their interpretability.
- **Temporary Variables:** Temp variables should be both short and descriptive, providing clarity on
  their purpose or use case.
- **Loop Indices:** Use single-letter abbreviations (e.g., `i`, `j`, `k`) for loop indices,
  maintaining simplicity and tradition in loop constructs.

### Files and Directories

- **Package Names:** Should be all lowercase, with multiple words concatenated together without
  underscores, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflict with language keywords or conventions.
- **Folder Names:** Use descriptive names for folders within your project to group related
  functionalities, features or modules.

## Documentation and Comments

Effective documentation and thoughtful comments are crucial for maintaining high code readability
and understandability. They help developers quickly grasp the purpose and logic behind code,
facilitating easier maintenance and future development.

### Writing Effective Code Comments

- **Clarity is Key:** Comments should illuminate the "why" behind the code's logic, not just
  reiterate the "what." Avoid redundant comments that merely echo the code itself.
- **Live Documentation:** Ensure comments remain relevant by updating them alongside the code they
  describe. Outdated comments can be more misleading than no comments at all.

### Documenting Your Code

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** All public classes, methods, and member variables must be clearly
  documented. This documentation should succinctly explain the component's purpose, usage,
  behaviors, parameters, return values, and exceptions thrown.
- **Actionable Details:** Incorporate code examples to demonstrate usage and expected outcomes,
  providing developers with actionable insights into how components function within the system.

### Inline Comments: Use Strategically

- **For Complexity:** Utilize inline comments to clarify complex code sections where the intent or
  logic is not immediately obvious. This practice aids in demystifying intricate algorithms or
  workflows.
- **Placement Matters:** Position inline comments directly above the relevant code segment to ensure
  they are easily associated with the correct lines of code. Avoid end-of-line comments for complex
  explanations to maintain readability.

### TODOs and FIXMEs: Track with a System

- **Tickets for the Win:** While `TODO:` and `FIXME:` comments can highlight areas needing
  refinement or further development, leveraging a dedicated issue tracking system is preferable.
  This method ensures better task organization, prioritization, and resolution.
- **Link to Trackers:** When employing `TODO:` or `FIXME:` comments, always reference the
  corresponding ticket number from your project's issue tracker. This connection ensures that
  comments are actionable, facilitating direct access to detailed task descriptions and discussions.

```{.kotlin .good-code title="Good"}
// TODO: [TICKET-1001] Implement the laser beam functionality for the cat's collar.
// FIXME: [TICKET-2001] The time machine's flux capacitor is not calculating leap years correctly.
```

```{.kotlin .bad-code title="Bad"}
// TODO: Make it better.
// FIXME: It doesn't work.
```

### Managing Deprecation and Obsolete Code

- **Mark for Deprecation:** Clearly label deprecated code segments with comments or annotations that
  outline the reason for their deprecation and suggest any available alternatives.
- **Clean Codebase:** Aim to remove deprecated code in subsequent releases to avoid clutter and
  confusion, promoting a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## Programming Practices

Adhering to sound programming practices not only ensures the creation of robust, maintainable, and
secure software but also facilitates efficient team collaboration. Below, we detail key practices
that underpin our development ethos.

### Code Simplicity and Clarity

- **Focus on Readability:** Prioritize writing code that is easily understandable, employing clear
  variable names and well-defined functions.
- **KISS Principle:** Embrace simplicity in your solutions. If a simpler approach yields the same
  result, prefer it over a more complex alternative.
- **Small Functions:** Decompose larger functions into smaller, focused units that are easier to
  manage and understand.

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Error Isolation:** Utilize try-catch blocks where applicable to manage exceptions
  effectively and maintain program stability.
- **Informative Error Messages:** Ensure error messages provide clear guidance on the issue and
  possible resolutions.
- **Anticipate and Manage Errors:** Design your code to gracefully handle potential errors, keeping
  the application robust and stable.

### Code Reusability and Modularity

- **Emphasize Reusability:** Strive for a codebase where functionality is encapsulated in reusable
  components, minimizing duplication and fostering consistency.
- **Utilize Functions and Classes:** Develop well-defined functions and classes that encapsulate
  specific functionalities, making them reusable across projects.
- **Create Modular Libraries:** Build and maintain libraries or modules that can be easily
  integrated into various projects, enhancing reusability.

### Performance Optimization

- **Consider Performance Throughout:** While not the initial focus, keep performance optimization in
  mind throughout the development process, especially in critical code paths.
- **Profiling Before Optimization:** Use profiling tools to identify and understand performance
  bottlenecks before embarking on optimization.
- **Efficiency and Laziness:** Choose efficient algorithms, avoid unnecessary computations, and
  implement lazy loading where applicable.

### Security Practices

- **Input Validation:** Vigilantly validate user input to guard against injection attacks.
- **Adhere to Secure Coding Guidelines:** Follow established secure coding practices to mitigate
  common vulnerabilities.
- **Stay Updated:** Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security fixes.
- **Early Threat Consideration:** Employ threat modeling early to identify and address security
  risks effectively.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Flexible Testing Approach:** Adapt your testing strategy to fit the project and team, whether it
  be TDD, BDD, or a mix of automated and manual testing.
- **Quality Through CI/CD:** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, ensuring
  consistent quality and rapid feedback loops.
- **Code Reviews for Quality:** Regularly conduct code reviews focusing on code quality,
  correctness, and security.

### Dependency Management

- **Effective Dependency Tools:** Utilize dependency management tools appropriate to your technology
  stack to maintain a consistent setup across environments.
- **Security and Updates:** Regularly review and update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities,
  using tools to automate vulnerability scanning.

### Code Reviews and Collaboration

- **Constructive Review Process:** Ensure code reviews are thorough and constructive, providing
  valuable feedback for improvement.
- **Promote Open Communication:** Encourage discussions and collaborative problem-solving during the
  review process.
- **Version Control Integration:** Leverage version control systems to manage contributions and
  facilitate code integration.

### Handling Technical Debt

- **Proactive Identification:** Use tools and code reviews to identify areas of technical debt,
  prioritizing their resolution based on impact.
- **Iterative Refactoring:** Address technical debt in manageable portions, integrating small
  refactorings into your regular development cycle.
- **Balance and Continuous Improvement:** Allocate time for addressing technical debt while
  balancing new feature development, adopting a continuous improvement mindset.
