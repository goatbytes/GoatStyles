# Objective-C Style Guide
## Introduction
Welcome to the Objective-C Style Guide, tailored for developers engaged in building robust applications using Objective-C, the primary programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS development before the advent of Swift. Objective-C combines C's power with the dynamic runtime and object-oriented capabilities of Smalltalk, making it a uniquely powerful language for Apple platforms.
### Purpose
This style guide aims to promote best practices in Objective-C programming, ensuring that code is not only functional and efficient but also clean, readable, and maintainable. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can enhance collaboration, streamline the development process, and build high-quality software that stands the test of time.
### Scope
The principles and practices outlined in this guide are applicable to a wide range of Objective-C projects, from small utility libraries to large-scale applications for Apple platforms. Whether you are a seasoned Objective-C developer or new to the language, following this guide will help you write better code, improve your development workflow, and collaborate more effectively with others in the Objective-C community. By committing to the standards set forth in this guide, developers can create Objective-C code that leverages the full potential of the language and the rich ecosystems of Apple platforms, resulting in applications that are not only powerful and responsive but also a pleasure to maintain and extend.
## General Principles
In Objective-C development, adhering to a set of general principles ensures that the codebase remains clean, efficient, and easy to maintain and scale. These principles guide the writing of code that not only works well but also integrates seamlessly into the larger ecosystem of Objective-C and Apple's frameworks.
### Readability and Clarity
*   **Prioritize Readability:** Code is read more often than it is written. Writing readable and clear code makes it easier for others (and yourself in the future) to understand and maintain it.

### Consistency
*   **Maintain Consistency:** A consistent codebase is easier to understand and navigate. Follow established conventions for formatting, naming, and structure within your project and the broader Objective-C community.

### Expressiveness
*   **Leverage Objective-C's Features:** Objective-C offers a rich set of features that promote expressive and dynamic code. Make full use of properties, categories, protocols, and blocks to write concise and powerful code.

### Modularity
*   **Embrace Modularity:** Design your code in modular components, which facilitates reuse, testing, and maintenance. Use classes, categories, and protocols to encapsulate functionality.

### Error Handling
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Anticipate and handle errors gracefully. Use NSError and exception handling judiciously to manage errors and provide meaningful feedback to users or calling code.

### Performance
*   **Optimize for Performance:** Write code that is not only correct but also efficient. However, don't prematurely optimize; make informed decisions based on profiling and actual needs.

### Security
*   **Consider Security Implications:** Be mindful of security in your coding practices. Validate inputs, manage memory wisely, and use Appleâ€™s security features to protect data and user privacy.

### Documentation
*   **Document Thoroughly:** Comprehensive documentation, both internal (in-code comments) and external (API documentation, READMEs), is crucial for long-term maintenance and team collaboration.

### Testing
*   **Commit to Testing:** Regularly write unit and integration tests. Testing ensures your code behaves as expected and facilitates safe refactoring and integration of new features.

## Formatting
### Line Length
*   **Maximum Line Length:** Aim to limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters. This enhances code readability and ensures compatibility across various editors and tools.
```objective-c
// Simulate goat movement considering potential map boundaries (98 characters)
goatPosition = [self ensureValidPosition:simulateGoatMovement(goat, worldMap)];
```
### Indentation
*   **Spaces for Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level for both code blocks and continuation lines. Avoid using tabs.
```objective-c
// Consistent indentation for complex goat abilities (uses 4 spaces)
if (isHeadbuttAvailable(goat) && isSpecialMoveEnabled(goat)) {
    goatPower *= MEGA_HEADBUTT_BOOST;  // Symbolic constant for clarity
    moveGoatFaster(goat);
    playGoatSoundEffect(goat, SFX_HEADBUTT_CHARGE);
} else if (isJetpackActive(goat)) {
    flyGoat(goat, boostHeight);
} else {
    moveGoat(goat, direction);
}
```
### Whitespace
*   **Vertical and Horizontal Whitespace:** Use vertical spacing judiciously to separate logical blocks of code. Include horizontal space around operators and after commas for better readability.
```objective-c
// Separate complex conditional statements with blank lines for clarity

goatPosition = simulateGoatMovement(goat, worldMap);

if (isJetpackActive(goat)) {
  flyGoat(goat, boostHeight);
} else if (isOnHay(goat) && isStarving(goat)) {
  // Goat is famished, prioritize hay over other powerups
  eatHay(goat);
  checkAvailablePowerUps(goat, availablePowerUps);
} else {
  moveGoat(goat, direction);
  checkAvailablePowerUps(goat, availablePowerUps);  // Check powerups even if not hungry
}
```

### Method Declarations and Calls
*   **Method Declarations:** Break lines at colons (`:`) aligning selector names and keeping parameters aligned.

```objective-c
// Break after selector, align complex parameter names (uses descriptive names)
- (void) activatePowerUp:(GoatPowerUpType)powerUpType onGoat:(Goat*)goat;
```

### Braces
*   **Brace Placement:** Place the opening brace on the same line as the statement for blocks, methods, and other control structures. The closing brace should be on its own new line.

```objective-c
if (isNearOtherGoats(goat)) {
  // Opening brace on same line as if statement
  playGoatSoundEffect(goat, SFX_HERD_CALL);
  checkForMatingOpportunities(goat);  // Goaty social life!
}
// Closing brace on a new line
```

### Comments
*   **Inline and End-of-Line Comments:** Use comments to explain "why" rather than "what". Place end-of-line comments on their own line above the code it's commenting on.

```objective-c
// End-of-line comment explaining complex logic (why)
// Consider special jump power-up for extra height if regular jump fails
if (!canReachLedge(goat)) {
  if (hasPowerUp(goat, GOAT_POWERUP_SUPER_JUMP)) {
    activatePowerUp(goat, GOAT_POWERUP_SUPER_JUMP);
    jumpGoat(goat);
  }
}
```

### Property Attributes
*   **Attribute Ordering:** When defining properties, place attributes in the following order: atomicity, storage, nullability, and accessors.

```objective-c
// Property with detailed comments for each attribute
@property (nonatomic, strong, nullable) NSString* favoriteFood;  // Goat's preferred food (can be
```

## Naming Conventions
Adopting clear and consistent naming conventions is crucial in Objective-C development, enhancing code readability and facilitating maintenance. This section outlines the principles and rules for naming classes, methods, variables, constants, and other identifiers in Objective-C.
### Classes and Protocols
*   **PascalCase:** Use PascalCase for classes, protocols, and enumeration types. Prefix class names with an abbreviation of your project or company name to avoid namespace collisions.

```objective-c
// Example of Class Naming Convention (using GoatBytes as company prefix)
GoatBytesHeadbuttAbility
```

### Methods
*   **camelCase:** Begin method names with a lowercase letter and use camelCase. For methods relating to actions performed on goats, start with a verb that describes the action.

```objective-c
// Example of Method Naming Convention (action verb for goats)
- (void) jumpThroughHoop:(Goat*)goat;
```

### Variables and Properties
*   **camelCase:** Use camelCase for naming variables and properties. Prefix instance variables with an underscore (`_`) to distinguish them from method names.

```objective-c
// Example of Variable and Property Naming Convention
NSString* _goatNickname;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString* favoriteFood;
```

### Constants
*   **k Prefix:** Prefix global constants with `k` followed by PascalCase. For module-specific constants, consider using a prefix that matches the module or class name.

```objective-c
// Example of Global Constant Naming Convention
static const int kMaxJumpsPerPowerUp = 3;

// Example of Module-Specific Constant Naming Convention (using GT for GoatTypes module)
const int GT_HAY_HEAL_AMOUNT = 20;
```

### Enumerations
*   **Enum Name as Type:** For enumerations, use PascalCase and prefix the enumeration name with an abbreviation that relates to the module or class. Enumeration values should also use PascalCase.

```objective-c
// Example of Enumeration Naming Convention
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, GoatPowerUpType) {
  GoatPowerUpTypeHeadbuttBoost,
  GoatPowerUpTypeJetpack,
  GoatPowerUpTypeSuperJump,
};
```

### Protocols
*   **Descriptive Names:** When naming protocols, be descriptive about the purpose or conformance the protocol represents. For delegate and data source protocols, include the class name in the protocol's name.

```objective-c
// Example of Protocol Naming Convention
@protocol GoatSoundEffectDelegate

// Example of Delegate Protocol Naming Convention (using GoatSFX for sound effects)
@protocol GoatSFXPlayerDelegate
```

## Comments and Documentation
Well-crafted comments and documentation are essential for maintaining the clarity, understandability, and usability of Objective-C code. This section focuses on best practices for effective commenting and leveraging Objective-C and Xcode features to create comprehensive documentation.
### Inline Comments
*   **Clarify Complex Logic:** Use inline comments to explain complex algorithms, decisions that are not immediately obvious, or to provide context that is not readily apparent from the code itself.

```objective-c
// Example of Inline Comment for Complex Logic (goat headbutt damage calculation)
// Apply bonus damage based on goat's horn strength
int headbuttDamage = baseDamage + (_goat.hornStrength * kHeadbuttStrengthMultiplier);
```

### Documentation Comments
*   **Use Xcode's Markup for Documentation:** Employ documentation comments above methods, properties, and classes to describe their purpose and usage. Xcode's markup syntax allows you to format these comments and include them in the Quick Help.

```objective-c
/**
 Feeds a particular goat with the specified food.

 @param goat The goat to be fed.
 @param food The type of food to feed the goat.
 @return A boolean indicating if the feeding was successful.
*/
- (BOOL)feedGoat:(GTFGoat *)goat withFood:(NSString *)food;
```

### Header Documentation
*   **Public Interfaces:** Document the public interfaces of your classes in the header files. This makes it easier for other developers to understand how to use your classes without needing to dive into the implementation details.

```objective-c
// GTFGoatFeeder.h
/**
 A class responsible for feeding goats.

 This class provides methods to feed goats efficiently and track their feeding status.
*/
@interface GTFGoatFeeder : NSObject

/**
 Feeds all hungry goats in the pen.

 @discussion This method iterates over all goats in the pen and feeds those that are hungry.
 @param pen The pen containing the goats to be fed.
*/
- (void)feedHungryGoatsInPen:(GTFGoatPen *)pen;

@end
```

### TODO and FIXME Comments
*   **Highlight Areas Needing Work:** Use `TODO:` and `FIXME:` comments to mark areas of the code that need improvement or completion. Include your initials and the current date for traceability.

```objective-c
// TODO: [TICKET-1234] Optimize goat feeding algorithm for larger pens
// FIXME: [GOAT-420] Resolve crash when goat name is nil
```

### Deprecation Notices
*   **Mark Deprecated Methods:** Use the `NS_DEPRECATED` macro to mark methods that are deprecated. Include a message directing developers to the preferred alternative.

```objective-c
- (void)oldFeedMethod NS_DEPRECATED(10_0, 10_4, 2_0, 2_0, "Use -feedGoat:withFood: instead");
```

### Avoid Commented-Out Code
*   **Remove Unused Code:** Instead of leaving commented-out code blocks in your codebase, rely on version control to keep a history of changes. Commented-out code can clutter your codebase and lead to confusion.

## Programming Practices
Adhering to effective programming practices is essential for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Objective-C code. This section outlines key practices that Objective-C developers should follow to optimize code quality and performance.
### Memory Management
*   **Understand and Apply ARC Correctly:** Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) manages the memory of your Objective-C objects. Ensure you understand ARC's rules around ownership and references to prevent memory leaks and retain cycles.

```objective-c
// Example of ARC Management (using strong and weak references)
// Goat owner strongly references the goat, while the hay is weakly referenced to avoid retain cycles
Goat* strongGoat = [[Goat alloc] init];
__weak Hay* weakHay = [self findNearestHay];
[strongGoat eatHay:weakHay];  // Goat eats the hay without creating a retain cycle
```

### Use of Literals
*   **Prefer Objective-C Literals:** Use Objective-C literals for `NSString`, `NSDictionary`, `NSArray`, and `NSNumber` to make your code more concise and readable.

```objective-c
// Example of Using Literals (cleaner and more readable approach)
NSString* goatNickname = @"Headbutt McGee";
NSDictionary* powerUpDetails = @{@"name": @"Jetpack", @"duration": @10};
NSArray* availableHays = @[@"Oat Hay", @"Clover Hay"];
```

### Immutable Objects
*   **Favor Immutability:** Whenever possible, use immutable objects to reduce complexity and improve thread safety. This is particularly important for collections that are shared or exposed publicly.

```objective-c
// Example of Immutable Object (creating an immutable copy of a mutable array
```

### Nullability Annotations
*   **Specify Nullability in Headers:** Use nullability annotations (`NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN`, `NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END`, `nullable`, `nonnull`) in your headers to provide more information to the compiler, improving code safety and reducing the possibility of null pointer exceptions.

```objective-c
// Example of Nullability Annotations (specifying nonnull for goat parameter)
@interface GoatManager
- (void) feedHayToGoat:(nonnull Goat*)goat;
@end
```

### Block Usage
*   **Avoid Retain Cycles with Blocks:** When capturing `self` in a block, especially in asynchronous calls, use a weak reference to avoid retain cycles.

```objective-c
// Example of Block with Weak Reference (avoiding retain cycles)
__weak Goat* weakSelf = self;
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
  // Perform asynchronous task
  if (weakSelf) {
    [weakSelf goatJumpedSuccessfully];  // Use weakSelf to avoid retain cycle
  }
});
```

### Error Handling
*   **Use NSError for Error Reporting:** When designing methods that can fail, use an `NSError` pointer to pass back error information to the caller.

```objective-c
// Example of Error Handling with NSError (checking for error during hay consumption)
NSError* error = nil;
BOOL hayConsumed = [goat eatHay:hay error:&error];
if (!hayConsumed && error) {
  NSLog(@"Error eating hay: %@", error.localizedDescription);
}
```

### Testing
*   **Write Unit Tests:** Leverage XCTest framework to write unit tests for your Objective-C classes. Testing contributes significantly to the robustness and maintainability of your code.

```objective-c
// Example of Unit Test (testing goat movement using XCTest)
- (void) testGoatMovement {
  Goat* goat = [[Goat alloc] init];
  goat.position = CGPointMake(100, 100);
  [goat moveForward];
  XCTAssertTrue(goat.position.x > 100, @"Goat should move forward");
}
```

By embracing these programming practices, Objective-C developers can ensure their codebases are not only performant and reliable but also easy to understand, maintain, and extend. This approach fosters a culture of quality and continuous improvement within the development team.

## Language-Specific Idioms and Patterns
Embracing Objective-C's language-specific idioms and patterns allows developers to write code that is both idiomatic and efficient, taking full advantage of the language's features and the Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks. This section highlights essential idioms and patterns unique to Objective-C programming, illustrated with examples related to managing a farm of goats.

### Delegate Patterns
*   **Use Delegates for Callbacks and Event Handling:** The delegate pattern is widely used in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch for callbacks and handling events. Define protocols for your delegates to ensure they implement the necessary methods.

```objective-c
// Example of Delegate Pattern (Goat informs Farmer about completion of task)

@protocol GoatTaskCompletionDelegate

- (void) goat:(Goat *)goat didCompleteTask:(NSString *)task;

@end

@interface Goat ()

@property (nonatomic, weak) id<GoatTaskCompletionDelegate> delegate;

@end

- (void) performTask {
  // Simulate some work performed by the goat
  sleep(2);
  [self.delegate goat:self didCompleteTask:@"Hay delivery"];
}
```

### Categories for Class Extensions
*   **Extend Classes with Categories:** Use categories to add methods to existing classes, including framework classes, without subclassing them. This is particularly useful for adding utility methods.

```objective-c
// Example of Category (Adding a method to calculate goat age in years)

@interface Goat (GoatAge)

- (int) calculateAgeInYears;

@end

@implementation Goat (GoatAge)

- (int) calculateAgeInYears {
  // Calculate age based on goat's birthdate
  NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
  NSDateComponents *ageComponents = [calendar components:NSCalendarUnitYear fromDate:self.dateOfBirth toDate:[NSDate date] options:0];
  return (int)ageComponents.year;
}

@end
```

### Use of `instancetype`
*   **Prefer** `instancetype` for Type-Specific Initializers: When defining initializers, return `instancetype` instead of `id` to ensure type safety and clarity.

```objective-c
// Example of Initializer with instancetype

@interface Goat alloc initWithName:(NSString *)name birthDate:(NSDate *)birthDate;

@end

@implementation Goat

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name birthDate:(NSDate *)birthDate {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    _name = name;
    _dateOfBirth = birthDate;
  }
  return self;
}

@end
```

### Collections and Fast Enumeration
*   **Leverage Fast Enumeration and Collection Literals:** Use fast enumeration (`for...in` loops) for iterating over collections. Prefer collection literals for concise and readable collection initialization.

```objective-c
// Example of Fast Enumeration and Collection Literals (feeding all goats hay)

NSArray<Hay*> *availableHay = ...; // Array of available hay objects

for (Hay *hay in availableHay) {
  [[GoatManager sharedInstance] feedHay:hay toGoats:self.goats];
}

// ...

@interface GoatManager

+ (instancetype)sharedInstance;

- (void) feedHay:(Hay *)hay toGoats:(NSArray<Goat*> *)goats;

@end
```

### Properties and Dot Syntax
*   **Use Properties and Dot Syntax for Encapsulation:** Define properties for encapsulating data and accessing instance variables. Use dot syntax for property access, which is more concise and readable.

```objective-c
// Example of Properties and Dot Syntax (accessing goat's name)

@interface Goat

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;

@end

@implementation Goat

// ...

- (void) introduceMyself {
  NSLog(@"I am a goat, and my name is %@", self.name);
}

@end
```

### Nil Checking
*   **Messages to** `nil` Are No-ops: Objective-C allows messages to be sent to `nil`, which simplifies nil checking in many cases. However, be mindful of cases where this behavior may lead to unexpected results, especially with methods expected to return non-nil values.

```objective-c
// Example of Nil Checking (checking for delegate before sending message)

if (self.delegate) {
  [self.delegate goat:self didCompleteTask:@"Fence repaired"];
} else {
  NSLog(@"No delegate assigned to receive task completion notification");
}
```

### Avoiding Primitive Obsession
*   **Use Strongly Typed Objects Over Primitives:** Instead of relying on primitives (e.g., `int`, `NSString *` for IDs), use more descriptive types or classes that can provide additional context and validation.

```objective-c
// Example of Primitive Obsession (using int for goat ID)
int goatID = 123;

// More descriptive approach (using GoatID class)
@interface GoatID : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString* identifier;

@end

@implementation GoatID

- (instancetype)initWithID:(NSString *)identifier {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    _identifier = identifier;
  }
  return self;
}

@end

GoatID* strongGoatID = [[GoatID alloc] initWithID:@"GOAT123"];

// Accessing the ID
NSLog(@"Primitive Goat ID: %d", goatID);
NSLog(@"GoatID object identifier: %@", strongGoatID.identifier);
```

By adhering to these Objective-C idioms and patterns, developers can write code that is not only in harmony with the language's ecosystem but also optimized for readability, maintainability, and performance.
## Tools and IDE Setup
Setting up an efficient and effective development environment is crucial for productivity in Objective-C programming. This section outlines essential tools and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) configurations for Objective-C developers, focusing on tools that support coding standards, improve code quality, and facilitate a smooth development process.
### Xcode
*   **Primary IDE for Objective-C:** Xcode, developed by Apple, is the most comprehensive and powerful IDE for Objective-C development, offering advanced code editing, debugging, and UI design capabilities.
    *   **Code Formatting:** Utilize Xcode's built-in code formatting features to maintain consistency. Customize formatting options in Xcode preferences to align with your project's style guide.
    *   **Refactoring Tools:** Leverage Xcode's refactoring tools to safely rename symbols, extract methods, and more, ensuring your code remains clean and maintainable.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Regularly use Xcode's built-in static analysis tool to detect potential memory leaks, logical errors, and other issues early in the development cycle.

### Clang Format
*   **Automate Code Styling:** `clang-format` is a versatile tool that automatically formats C, C++, and Objective-C code, making it easier to enforce coding standards across your project.
    *   Create a `.clang-format` file in your project's root directory to define style rules.
    *   Integrate `clang-format` with Xcode using scripts or plugins to format files on save or before commits.

### Dependency Management
*   **CocoaPods for Managing Libraries:** Use CocoaPods, an Objective-C dependency manager, to integrate third-party libraries into your projects easily.
    *   Define your project's dependencies in a `Podfile`, and use CocoaPods to manage library versions and updates seamlessly.

### Documentation
*   **HeaderDoc for Generating API Documentation:** Use HeaderDoc, a documentation tool for C-based languages, to generate HTML documentation from comments in your source files.
    *   Follow the HeaderDoc comment syntax in your header files to document classes, methods, and properties, providing valuable insights for API consumers and fellow developers.

### Linting
*   **Objective-Clean for Linting:** While not as prevalent as in other languages, linting tools like Objective-Clean can help enforce coding standards and style consistency in Objective-C projects.
    *   Configure linting rules to match your style guide and integrate them into your build process or IDE to catch style violations early.

By leveraging these tools and configuring your IDE to align with best practices, Objective-C developers can enhance their productivity, ensure code quality, and streamline the development and maintenance of their applications.
