# Contributing to GoatStyles

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to GoatStyles! This project is a repository for professional code style guides used by GoatBytes.IO and the wider software development community. Our aim is to uphold the highest standards of software engineering practices, making the development process more efficient and secure.

## Using the Style Guides

GoatStyles is actively used by GoatBytes.IO internally to ensure consistency, quality, and security across our projects. The style guides within this repository reflect our current best practices and are subject to updates as our standards evolve.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a typo, proposing a new section, or suggesting changes to an existing guide, your input is valuable. Here's how you can contribute:

### Fork the Repository

Due to the diversity in coding standards across different organizations, we recommend creating a 
fork of the GoatStyles repository for any significant modifications or additions. This approach 
allows you to customize the style guides to better fit your organizational needs while contributing 
valuable insights back to the main project.

PRs may be closed if they do not align with our internal standards or current needs. However,
